## Nose cone bay

The payload section for this rocket is relatively small considering the weight of the rocket and the parachute size required. I also **hate** to waste all of that empt space in the nose cone so I build a removable base for the nose cone that maximises the payload space and allows for mounting equipment inside the nosecone itself

Materials

|Qty | Item | Source |
|--- |---   |--- |
| 5 | M6 connector nuts | [ToolStation](https://www.toolstation.com/connector-nut/p29740) |
| 4 | M6 X 50mm Pan Head Machine Screws | [ScrewFix](https://www.screwfix.com/p/easyfix-bright-zinc-plated-pan-head-machine-screws-m6-x-50mm-25-pack/8253j_) |
| 4 | M6 x 25mm Socket Cap Screws | [ToolStation](https://www.toolstation.com/stainless-steel-socket-cap-screw/p36417) |
| 1 | M6 X 11 Eye Bolt | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01M1IPKPA/) |

### Prepare the base

The base plate is constructed as follows

* Mark the position for the four mounting holes
  * Allow for the flat side of the connector nut to be flush to the side of the disk
* Drill the holes using a 6mm drill bit
* Assemble the Allen bolts into the connector nuts

### Prepare the Mounts

The base is now mounted into the nose cone / payload bay coupler by

* Attach the M6 Pan Head screws into the connector nuts
* Insert the plate into the coupler so it is flat and square
* Prepare the fibreglass
  * horizontal lengths fibreglass
  * vertical length fibreglass
  * Bulldog clips
  * baking parchment
* Apply the fibreglass
  * one vertical piece
  * one horizontal piece
  * cover with baking parchment to allow removal
  * clip in place to ensure the fibreglass wraps around the bolt

The result is difficult to see in the photos, but the bolts and connector nuts are secured to the inside fo the coupler

### Finish the Mount

At this point, the eye-bolt is secured to the plate using an M6 Connector nut. This allows for using a threaded rod _inside_ the nosecone to mount equipment (GPS, etc.) and take advantage of all that space!

The base is easily removed and attached using the four socket head screws.

Unless you can drill the mounting holes _exactly_ distanced, which I am not able to do, marking one of the holes on the plate and coupler side will ensure you can get things to align correctly the next time.
